I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [New York Proton Center](https://www.nyproton.com/). I am working on various projects related to [proton therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_therapy), in particular one exciting possibility of what proton therapy could look like in the future (specifically, FLASH radiotherapy and its [experimental validation](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mp.15706)).

I obtained my Ph.D. in Experimental Particle Physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where I looked for as-yet-unknown particles and forces, possibly components of the dark sector of matter (in particle sub-GeV scale [axion-like particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13439)) and characterized a novel Cherenkov radiation based particle identification detector (the GlueX [DIRC detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11382)). Before that, I obained my undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I worked with data from the CDF experiment at the Tevatron and the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.

If you stumbled upon this website and have made it this far, I really appreciate it! I created this website (along with the two items under [Random Things](/project/)) really just for fun quite a while ago when I was doing night shifts for GlueX during my PhD... I don't update this often (at least for now), and if you have made it this far, please refer to [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunjiey/), which I do update slightly more frequently, for more about me.
