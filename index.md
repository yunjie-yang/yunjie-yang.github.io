I am a graduate student in [the Department of Physics](http://web.mit.edu/physics/) and the [Laboratory for Nuclear Science](http://web.mit.edu/lns/index.html) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.

I work on advancing our knowledge of fundamental particles,
in particular on the searches for those as-yet-unknown particles and forces, possibly components of the dark sector of matter. Currently, I am working on the GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab, Virginia.
